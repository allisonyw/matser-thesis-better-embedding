# matser-thesis-better-embedding

Using signatures in BERT and bi-LSTM NLP neural networks.

This is the code for the master thesis 'On a better representation of natural language in vector spaces', Yiran Wei, 2019

The signature calculation uses the Signatory library. 

# Data

Datasets as introduced in the thesis can be found in the data file. 

# sig-transformer

Modules called in the SIG+ notebooks have signature methods implemented.
The truncation order are indicated by the names. For example, (reduced dimension, truncation order)=(4,2) would correspond to modelling_bert42.py.
